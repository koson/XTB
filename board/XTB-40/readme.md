‚ùó Analog power supply is set with resistor located below C1/C4.

- Place a 0ohm resistor above "AVDD" to supply your own analog power on AVDD and GND pins (AS PICTURED). Default AVDD external reference is 5V (TI LM4120). Must supply 5.5V or more to AVDD when using this voltage reference.
- Place a 0ohm resistor above "3.3V" to use the on-board AVDD (NOT SHOWN)

3.3V AVDD is convienent, but limits voltage reference to the internal 2.5V reference. The external reference allows for 5V (pre-installed) voltage reference and has low temperature drift.
