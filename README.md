## Datalogging with the XTB
operating, measuring, and saving data with the XTB boards is handled by a microcontroller. Nearly any microcontroller will work, and the code is written in Arduino to aid in use. The example below uses an [Adafruit Feather M0 with SD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796) for easy datalogging capability.
